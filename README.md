# Machine Learning

* Training a machine to do "Human" things. 
* To recognize patterns the way humans do.
* Need LARGE data set
* Need lots of different "settings". Like a photo in lots of different locations. 
* photos, audio, text.
* Training data 80%
* test data 20%

## Creating Models

* The BRAAAAINS ðŸ§ 
* It's the thing you "train" 
* Linear Algebra and Multivariable Calculus, so the GPU gets used.
* Models can be relatively small, but they take up a lot of processing power.

## Turi Create

* A ton of frameworks that we can use to create models.
* Turi create is cool because it's cross platform, exports core ml models, and other reasons....
